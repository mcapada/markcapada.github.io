                            for Network Systems Administration -</a> The scope for the competition was very vague with
                        the intention of having competitors not know what to expect. The scope included various areas
                        that were taught in post-secondary, but also had areas that are too specific for some
                        classes to cover.

                    <p class="headerthing2 text-left nonselect">
                        The four main areas in the provincial competition were Linux Server, Windows Server, Routing and
                        Switching, and Network Planning/Connectivity. This included Windows Server 2016 CLI
                        administration involving ADDS, DHCP, and DNS. Cisco routers and wwitches were configured using
                        various protocols (including OSPF and VLAN) and network addresses had to be planned and
                        allocated correctly. Finally, Ubuntu Server CLI administration involved FTP, SSH, Apache2 and
                        Samba.</p>

                        similar to the provincial's scope. However, there was a higher emphasis on detail and accuracy.
                        In addition to the tasks in Windows Server, implementations of RDP, GPO, and network monitoring
                        had to be performed. Additionally, LDAP, DHCP, security management and RAID partitioning were
                        expected of competitors in the Linux Server stage. The switched network provided was large scale
                        and involved protocols such as NAT, Ether-Channel, ACLs, VPN Tunnels and Port Security in order
                        to work.

                            how <i>big</i> Skills really was -</a> I had the opportunity to represent my college and
                        province doing what I do best. I discovered a new-found confidence in my work and abilities -
                        despite the feeling self-doubt, I can still come out successful. I won't ever forget this
                        experience that I had, and I am eager to compete again for 2020. I was truly taken back by how
                        big Skills, as an organization, really was. They are a global initiative and bring in the most
                        talented of individuals. What I really enjoyed about my Skills Canada experience was being
                        around the best in the province because they, too, probably believed that they couldn't even
                        win in provincials.
