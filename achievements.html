                            Information Technology -</a> I began studying at Centennial College for my degree in
                        September
                        2016. Having just one semester left in my studies, I can confidently say that the course path
                        delivered so much in terms of areas of expertise for me. My greatest achievements come from my
                        education at
                        Centennial College, which (to name a few) are my Skills Competition involvement and my overall
                        <a style="text-decoration-line: none;" class="headerlink hoverelement2" href="#">GPA of
                            4.12</a>.
                        Graduating with Honors is, ultimately, a reflection of the hardwork and commitment that I had
                        set for myself four years prior that I couldn't be prouder for.

                        I did not know what to expect because I had never heard of Skills Ontario before. The
                        competition for
                        Nationals was <a style="text-decoration-line: none;" class="headerlink hoverelement2"
                            href="#">eight hours long</a> and tested us on <i>everything</i> I had studied in my degree
                        over the last three years (and more!). Long story short, competing was incredibly difficult and
                        intimidating
                        given that there are so many areas of knowledge involved. I managed to place <a

                            Ontario</a> for my respective field, which included an invitation to compete on the <a

                            href="#">Halifax, Nova Scotia</a>. The contest scope included so much <i>more</i> in terms
                        of areas of
                        expertise for Network Systems Administration. Unlike the provincial competition where I was
                        given a couple months to prepare, the Nationals only gave two weeks. The competition lasted 12
                        hours over the course of two days. At the end of the competition, I couldn't manage to get a
                        podium placement, but I went through a <a style="text-decoration-line: none;"
                            class="headerlink hoverelement2" href="#">life-changing experience</a>. Looking back at it
                        now, I had
                        self-doubt in my abilities for the Skills Ontario competition, but I managed to place first.
                        This shows me that even though I may show signs of uncertainty, I am still capable of <a
